# StudentManagementSystem-ObjectOrientedProgramming

## Overview

StudentManagementSystem is a comprehensive Java application developed as part of the Spring'22 semester project. It is designed to manage student data effectively, leveraging core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a robust and scalable system.

## Features

- Add, update, delete, and view student records
- Manage courses and enrollments
- Generate student performance reports

## Core OOP Principles Implemented

This project incorporates fundamental OOP concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data by making fields private and providing public getter and setter methods.
- **Inheritance**: Creating a hierarchy of classes to promote code reuse.
- **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and interfaces to define common interfaces for related classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic method binding.

## Additional OOP Concepts

- **Interfaces**: Used to define the contracts for various functionalities.
- **Abstract Classes**: For creating base classes that cannot be instantiated but can be extended.
- **Composition**: Building complex types by combining objects of other types.
- **Aggregation**: Establishing relationships where the child can exist independently of the parent.
